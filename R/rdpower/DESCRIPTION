Description: The regression discontinuity (RD) design is a popular quasi-experimental design for causal inference and policy evaluation. The 'rdpower' package provides tools to perform power, sample size and MDE calculations in RD designs: rdpower() calculates the power of an RD design, rdsampsi() calculates the required sample size to achieve a desired power and rdmde() calculates minimum detectable effects. See Cattaneo, Titiunik and Vazquez-Bare (2019) <https://rdpackages.github.io/references/Cattaneo-Titiunik-VazquezBare_2019_Stata.pdf> for further methodological details.
